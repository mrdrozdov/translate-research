so if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .

aa thank you .
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .
now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they &apos;re dispersed , imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations .
twenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction , literally things that are built upside down and back-to-front .
so we know for our 17,000 managers across ikea that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management .
the world was changing .
he wants to help . he told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies .

what did i do ? did i follow my gut ?
de-extinction falls in that category .
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
it was : &quot; what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? &quot;
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself , charming though it is , but rather to these photos .
and it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
it &apos;s inviting participation , and cities have , historically , invited all sorts of participation .
democracy , citizenship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if your animal is sick .
and finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy , and he goes up to saul and he says , &quot; i &apos;ll fight him . &quot;

the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
what we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , i believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels .
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation .
so we &apos;re shifting to an experience economy , where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering .

that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step motors inside of the pen .
so these are the kinds of layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to lead you through today -- the question of , what are the intentions that you bring to bear when you &apos;re designing something ?
why would you choose rats ?
are there moms who &apos;ve raised boys around that table ?
i was born and raised in north korea .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
sure , i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what i &apos;d sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable .
we showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; all right , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
and then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra .
so if you threaten to use it , people are going to comply with it , but it &apos;s also going to be something that doesn &apos;t leave any lasting effects . &quot;
thank you .
when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls , who have run away , with their families .
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , polite requests , solicitations and threats so often veiled ?
we &apos;ve known about fusion since 1920 , when sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science conjectured that that &apos;s why the sun shines .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
i &apos;m working already . &quot;
it &apos;s called universe : revealing our modern mythology .
but if they respond , there &apos;s a range of other people around , who are innocent people who might also get hurt -- be collateral damage that the military often doesn &apos;t want to talk about .
there are emotions of the victims .
but openness and inter-connectedness , it comes with a cost when we think about disease . i don &apos;t think this should be a surprise .
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle .
okay , here we go .
however , what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value , and it &apos;s much fairer .
my experience , however , in the islamic world is very different .
after winning this prize , my life changed .
when i was secretary of state , there were only 13 other women foreign ministers .
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
i went to see a friend of mine , and he made me wait in his apartment in malabar hill on the twentieth floor , which is a really , really upmarket area in mumbai .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot;
the world layma bowie was given was a world at war .

alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who &apos;s fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness , whether to restore hearing to the deaf , vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .

and the mexican borders , but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet .
nick -- the camera , again , an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this .
so , i hope to convince you that complex doesn &apos;t always equal complicated .
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn &apos;t imagine doing anything else .
okay , now i don &apos;t want to alarm anybody in this room , but it &apos;s just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .

it &apos;s a 28-page software patent , but i will summarize what it covers . spoiler alert : unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger .

so the internet needs addressing and directions .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
for example , in this case , even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity .

they were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
if you have a baby and you think that baby &apos;s gay , you should be allowed to put it up for adoption .
so , those energy , matter einstein show were equivalent , and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all interrelated , so it &apos;s one long continuum .
